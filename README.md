There are three files in the repo:

artificial_neuron.py - This calculates output for a single perceptron

mlp_forwardprop.py - This does a forward proopagation to a network

mlp_eval.py - This contains the complete step for a multilayer perceptron. Does forward propagation, backpropagation, calculates lost functions, gradient descent, train models
